Approach:

Traverse through the request array and find the minimum distance between each request to other blocks,
then find the maximum of all the distance in each array. Now return the index of minmum of the max elements from the array.


Details:

getmindist()- >  returns a array of arraylist which contains the distance between the request and each blocks

getmaxdist()-> returns the maximum value in each array list of every request element and returns the array.

apartmenthinding()-> the main function which returns the answer - which returns the index of the minimum of the all maximum values from the array returned from getmaxdistance()
